Your order started it's journey by transforming into tiny bits of energy called "data" to be sent underneath the ocean floor.

Those tiny bits of data high-fived our inbox here at Eternal Journal
Headquaters and upon seeing your confirmation, everyone broke down into
tears - we are so happy for you!

      As the receipt was being printed out of our gold-plated & plaid printer,
      the whole team gathered in the room, cheering on the whole process.

      The silken-strewn paper holding your order details was gently placed on a
      red-satin pillow by a knight of the roundtable.

      He bowed before the setting sun and sent blessings to you and your loved
      ones for three hours.

      After the initial cerimony was complete, we decided it was best to frame
      your purchase in every office we own

      Our private jet is currently en-route to our Antartica Base where 300
      tiny-elves are meticulouslly hand-crafting your journal.

      Many famous artists volunteer their time to paint each cover - just to
      make you happy.
